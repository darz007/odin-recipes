What I learned from this Project: 
- I have become quite profficient at Linux command line basics. e.g. creating, delating, modifying and moving directories and files.
- The basics of both Git in command line on Linux and linking it to Github and e.g. creating repos, commits and pushing them to Github.
- In Visual Studio Code "!" + Enter outputs the boilerplate HTML for a webpage. This will help with future effiency.
- All the HTML content was very basic for me, I already knew all the content from past experience, there was no new content that I learned here other than the handy VSC tip mentioned above.
- I intentionally refrained from using any CSS as the focus of this section of the course is learning only HTML.
